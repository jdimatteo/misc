I made some changes to clean up plotFromFile.html.  I also added keyboard controls and updated the csv file processing to handle a newline at the end of the file.

The licence was in .docx format, and I converted it to .txt so that it is more easily readable.  Unfortunately the licence doesn't appear complete, and still includes place holder text like "Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]".  I just left it as is.
